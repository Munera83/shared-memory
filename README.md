# Shared-memory
a C code illustrates shared memory between processes.<br>
I have used this code using a virtual machine and Linux operating system, specifically Ubuntu.<br>
In order to compile this you need to write (gcc [filename].c -o [exutable file name] -lrt).<br>
The code allows the user to enter what they need and store it in the shared memory, then another process reads the shared memory and displays it.<br>
The main parts of the code are from: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/posix-shared-memory-api/. <br>
A sample run is shown below.
